# Usage
`downloader.py [delay in seconds (optional, defaults to 0)]`

**Warning: archive.org will most likely rate limit or even ban your IP from this without using an adequate delay value. The script will take about a month to run nonstop through all approximately 960,000 entries and totals approximately 133.5 GB.**
# Description
This script recursively downloads all files from saved webpages on archive.org's Wayback Machine that are from the S3 buckets of the now shut down Flipnote Gallery: World DSi Gallery. It contains almost all Flipnotes from the original Flipnote Haetna service on the DSi converted to the KWZ format ([source](https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Flipnote_Gallery_World)). Documentation on the KWZ format can be found [here](https://github.com/Flipnote-Collective/flipnote-studio-3d-docs/wiki/kwz-format).
